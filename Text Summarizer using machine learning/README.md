# Text Summarizer

Text Summarization involves condensing a piece of text into a shorter version, reducing the size of the original text while preserving key information and the meaning of the content. The intention to summarize a text is to create an accurate and fluid summary containing only the main points described in the document.
Generally, Text Summarization is classified into two main types: Extraction Approach and Abstraction Approach. I have used the extractive approach to summarize text using Machine Learning and Python. I will use the TextRank algorithm which is an extractive and unsupervised machine learning algorithm for text summarization.
Here we have used the Glove method for word representation, it is an unsupervised learning algorithm. To implement this method you can download the file from here: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
